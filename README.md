#### Lets Study OpenSSL:

**Create a private key | encrypted:**
```bash
openssl genrsa -aes128 -out fd.key 2048
```


**Note:** This command prompts for a password. Do not forget password or you will not be able to 'decrypt' said key for whatever reason.


**Inspect the key by using the following command:**
```bash
openssl rsa -text -in fd.key 
```
